# Grocery_Product_Sales
Code for American grocery store sales data by units, transactions, stores, product category

## This research aims to detect variables that predict units purchased for a large American grocery market chain.

Data was provided through my graduate program as part of curriculur relationship with supplier market research firm.

The first data set, titled, "Transaction data", notes the observation of universal product code for variables includingweek-end date, store ID, units sold, price of item, display and feautre status of the item, among others.

The second data set, titled, "Products lookup", notes the observation of universal product code for variables including the manufacturer, category and sub-category of product, among others.

The third data set, titled, "Store lookup", notes the store numbers and includes city, state and MSA, among others.

The three sets were left divided for manageable feature engineering, data visualization, etc.

The dataframes were subsequently concatenated through key columns and interesting relationships are modeled through regression modeling.
